Module: Airfoil_Patch.py
------------------------------------------

Creates a NURBS patch around an airfoil. Use a least squares approach to determine the 
locations of the control points. Take as input the number of control points desired and 
spline order. 

Use a standard approach to place the slipwall on one xi/eta location, 
farfield on another, etc...
