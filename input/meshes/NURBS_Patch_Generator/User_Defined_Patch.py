Module: user_defined_patch.py
------------------------------------------

Sets a user defined patch. That is, the user can manually set all 
the patch information, such as the knot vectors, weights and control
point locations. 

This module is good for testing purposes or for checking simple patch
geometries. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the NURBS patch parameter relations are respected
	(ex: The number of control points is dependent on the knot vector, etc...).
	Checks will be done to ensure this is the case
